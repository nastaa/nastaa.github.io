### About

I did my doctoral studies at the University of East Anglia, and am currently a visiting scholar in the department of philosophy at University of Pittsburgh.  
My work is on the semantics of indexicals, anaphora, and the scope of quantifiers, modals and other operators. I also try to exploit insights from linguistic and philosophical semantics to approach issues in the general philosophy of science (concerning explanation), and in epistemology (concerning probabilistic reasoning). 

AOS: philosophy of language and linguistics 
AOC: philosophical logic, philosophy of science
Dissertation: economy-principles in linguistics
