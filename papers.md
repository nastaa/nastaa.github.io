<h3>Thesis</h3>

+ **Varieties of Linguistic Economy. Essays on Scope and Binding** 

In this work, I approach the topic of linguistic economy according to the following plan. 
I begin by presenting the principles that were at the origin of the linguistic economy accounts, and point to their key methodological motivations.  
In the first two parts of the thesis, I criticise two accounts of the linguistic economy of scope and binding, drawing attention to their strong features, as well as to their conceptual shortcomings. 
In each of the two parts, I further propose alternative accounts that overcome the shortcomings of their predecessors, at the same time preserving their strengths.  
In particular, in chapter 2, I establish a novel connection between scope and scalar implicatures and, in chapter 4, I develop a semantic/pragmatic account of binding by improving the empirical coverage of the principle of denotational economy. 
The main conclusion of the first two parts of the thesis is that we should reformulate the accounts based on linguistic economy in terms of semantic and pragmatic principles. 
If we do so, our accounts of scope and binding will gain both empirical and conceptual advantages.  
Finally, in chapters 5 and 6, I draw some substantive consequences for the semantics of complex demonstratives (and other definites), and also for the purported logicality of binding and scope constructions, relying on principles of linguistic economy. 
More concretely, I argue based on truth-conditional economy that complex demonstratives are best conceived as non-directly referential. 
In the final chapter I demonstrate that linguistic economy entails logicality of natural language, and that the arguments to the contrary are inconclusive.

<h3>Other drafts (abstracts only)</h3>

<li>**Pragmatic scope economy**    
Is scope a syntactic phenomenon or rather a pragmatic one? In addressing this question, I asses a strong version of the principle of economy that governs the syntactic scope of quantifiers and other operators in natural language. I find that although the strong economy principle covers a range of data, it fails to predict many others. Better alternative conceptions of scope spanning the conceptual space from the more conservative conceptions to the more revisionary ones might become more attractive. I argue for an alternative moderate view that puts more weight on pragmatic principles in order to account for the main scope possibilities (understood as salient possibilities). According to such a view, scope is to a large extent a pragmatic phenomenon. It is nevertheless possible to preserve the insights of a weaker, syntax-based, economy principle. I argue that this has both conceptual and empirical advantages over the strong economy approach.

<li>**Grammar, economy, and rationality**    
Linguistic and philosophical studies of language have advanced different high-order constraints on the syntactic and pragmatic aspects of language. Among such constraints are economy conditions (in narrow syntax and its interfaces) and rationality conditions (in the semantics/pragmatics interface). Since these constraints are regarded as entirely different from one another, syntax and pragmatics have been seen as completely distinct in their methodology and explanation. Only pragmatics, it is claimed, makes theoretical use of a notion of rationality, while syntax does not have any place for such a notion. In this paper I show that the two notions of economy and rationality have more in common than previously thought, despite being part of frameworks with different subject matters. So, my contention is that grammar (broadly speaking) is minimally rational in both a theoretical and an instrumental sense. Otherwise put, if we bring together the economy of syntax and the rationality of pragmatics, what we get is a minimally rational grammar.

<li>**Economy and the computation of scalar implicatures**    
This paper is concerned with emphasizing the different economy-properties of the computation of scalar implicatures presupposed by two competing views: the globalist and the localist approach to the computation of scalar implicatures. The latter is, according to a formal metric to be specified, more economical. After showing that this is the case, I defend the relevance of such an economy property of the computational system.

<h3>Reviews</h3>
*The Philosophy of Generative Linguistics (by Peter Ludlow)"*    
In this review, apart from briefly summarising the book's chapters, I discuss Ludlow's externalist account of proper names and his treatment of theoretical virtues such as simplicity.
