### Main interests 

Linguistics and linguistic economy I study the role of economy-principles in representing and/or explaining various aspects of natural language phenomena such as quantification, connectives, anaphora, conventional and scalar implicatures. My main focus is on scope and binding phenomena though.
In my thesis I spell out the idea(s) of linguistic economy and then defend a broad economy-theoretic approach (roughly, along the lines of the Minimalist Program in linguistics). In particular, I defend a semantic notion of substantive economy.

Linguistic modalities I’m interested in how the standard modal semantics can accommodate information about degree of (un)certainty. I’m also interested in the potential role that the heuristic principle of removing contradictions might play in the modal semantics.

### Other interests

Minds and machines I’m interested in mathematical logic and some related foundational notions of cognitive science: computation, complexity, and the frame problem(s).
Geometry As for the long term projects, I would like to investigate some conceptual aspects of geometry: its relation to cognition (`visual’ reasoning) and language (does linguistic competence rely on `geometrical’ thinking?).
