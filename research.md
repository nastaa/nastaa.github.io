### Main interests 

My main research interests are in the philosophy of language, and are closely related to issues in linguistics and philosophical logic.  

+ *anaphora under perspective*: anaphoric expressions refer back to their antecedents under a distinct perspective; I ask what is the typology of perspectival semantic values, and whether these perspectival values should be conceived as indexical, Fregean guises, or quantificational restrictors. 
+ *logic in natural language*: I argue that several explanatory strategies in linguistics (e.g. linguistic economy hypotheses) make a substantive use of logical properties, and that this is a prima facie argument for the logicality of natural language.
+ *qualitative modalities*: I investigate how qualitative modalities can be a basis for quantitative ones (that is, quantitative probabilties). 


### Other interests

I'm interested in some topics in the general philosophy of science, especially in relation to some historical figures such as Euclid and Descartes. 

+ I propose to look at scientific and mathematical explanation from a linguistic perspective; As a case study, I want to look at how geometrical explanation works in relation to non-geometrical modes of thinking.
