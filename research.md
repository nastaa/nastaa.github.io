I'm working in the philosophy of language, broadly conceived as including some aspects of linguistics, philosophical logic, and general philosophy of science. 
I wrote a thesis about the notion of linguistic economy and defended a more pragmatic understanding of the term. 
At present I focus on two projects to do with anaphora and probabilistic modality, respectively. 


### Anaphora

I am interested in the notion(s) of perspective implicit in the ways competent speakers use noun phrases and anaphoric expressions.    
My task is to find a baseline account of the denotations of noun phrases (NPs) in terms of which to formulate a general theory of anaphora, and then distil two relatively homogeneous categories of *perspectival* NPs in order to give a systematic account of the apparent exceptions to the baseline picture. One consequence of this view is that it captures the similarities between the NPs that enter in intra- and extra-clausal anaphoric relations.
At a more foundational level, I argue that we need to give up the distinction between 'bound-variable' pronouns and deictic pronouns, and similar dichotomies. 
The ensuing view of anaphora unifies several apparently disparate phenomena. 

Within this project, I'm writing a paper about a variety of descriptive indexicals (e.g. the speaker-denoting subject NP *mummy* in *Mummy is going to tell Johnny off*) and epithets (e.g. *the idiot*), which, as I will argue, are the anaphoric cousins of the aforementioned descriptive indexicals. 
Another paper is about a category of pronouns that are alleged to have very specialised pragmatic effects in certain linguistic contexts. I call those pronouns *specialised pronouns*, and argue that they don't really exist in natural language. An alleged example of a specialised pronoun is the somewhat atypical word *him* in the sentence: *If everyone despises Oscar, Oscar despises him too*. 

### Modality

I have an interest in words that express uncertainty, namely probabilistic modals. 
My main question is about the connection between qualitative and quantitative modals, e.g. *likely* vs *51\% likely*. 
The position I defended is this: although some regions of discourse certainly appeal to quantitative representations of uncertainty, (i) a qualitative approach can do more for the semantics of modality than usually recognised. And (ii) the relationship between quantitative and qualitative probabilities isn't simply a question of pragmatically adding a (quantitative) probability space on top of a qualitative semantics of modality; rather a more realistic relation between the semantic and pragmatic representations of linguistic uncertainty is a partial isomorphism between the qualitative and quantitative scales. As a result of their semantic and pragmatic competence, natural language speakers grasp only *partially* the quantitative probabilistic structures over possible worlds. 

I'm writing a paper that spells out the partial relation between qualitative and quantitative modals by focusing on the contextual interpretations of statements such as *The more red balls are in the urn, the more preferable a red ball is* or *If there are not too many red balls, other balls are preferable*. In another paper I discuss a type of context sensitivity of deontic modals (e.g. *should*, *ought to*) based on a well-known decision-theoretic [thought experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellsberg_paradox "Ellsberg's Paradox"), which was presented by Ellsberg in the 1960s. This thought experiment shows that deontic modals are sensitive to all sorts of inconsistent constraints imposed by our cognitive capacity. On the basis of this observation, I propose---or rather reinforce---a division between semantic and pragmatic principles governing modality. 



### Thesis

*Varieties of Linguistic Economy. Essays on Scope and Binding* 
Andrei Nasta
2014

In this work, I approach the topic of linguistic economy according to the following plan. 
I begin by presenting the principles that were at the origin of the linguistic economy accounts, and point to their key methodological motivations.  
In the first two parts of the thesis, I criticise two accounts of the linguistic economy of scope and binding, drawing attention to their strong features, as well as to their conceptual shortcomings. 
In each of the two parts, I further propose alternative accounts that overcome the shortcomings of their predecessors, at the same time preserving their strengths.  
In particular, in chapter 2, I establish a novel connection between scope and scalar implicatures and, in chapter 4, I develop a semantic/pragmatic account of binding by improving the empirical coverage of the principle of denotational economy. 
The main conclusion of the first two parts of the thesis is that we should reformulate the accounts based on linguistic economy in terms of semantic and pragmatic principles. 
If we do so, our accounts of scope and binding will gain both empirical and conceptual advantages.  

Finally, in chapters 5 and 6, I draw some substantive consequences for the semantics of complex demonstratives (and other definites), and also for the purported logicality of binding and scope constructions, relying on principles of linguistic economy. 
More concretely, I argue based on truth-conditional economy that complex demonstratives are best conceived as non-directly referential. 
In the final chapter I demonstrate that linguistic economy entails logicality of natural language, and that the arguments to the contrary are inconclusive.
